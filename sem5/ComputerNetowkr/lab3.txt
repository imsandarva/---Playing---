# Lab 3: Cisco Commands in Packet Tracer
## Step-by-Step Manual

---

## STEP 1: BUILD THE NETWORK

### Add Devices:
- 1 Router (2911)
- 2 Switches (2960)
- 4 PCs (2 per switch)

### Connect Devices (Copper Straight-Through):
- PC0 → Switch0
- PC1 → Switch0
- PC2 → Switch1
- PC3 → Switch1
- Switch0 → Router GigabitEthernet0/0
- Switch1 → Router GigabitEthernet0/1

---

## STEP 2: CONFIGURE PC IP ADDRESSES

### Network 1 (Switch0):
**PC0:**
- IP: 192.168.1.10
- Subnet: 255.255.255.0
- Gateway: 192.168.1.1

**PC1:**
- IP: 192.168.1.11
- Subnet: 255.255.255.0
- Gateway: 192.168.1.1

### Network 2 (Switch1):
**PC2:**
- IP: 192.168.2.10
- Subnet: 255.255.255.0
- Gateway: 192.168.2.1

**PC3:**
- IP: 192.168.2.11
- Subnet: 255.255.255.0
- Gateway: 192.168.2.1

## STEP 3: CONFIGURE ROUTER (CLI)

### Click Router → CLI Tab → Press Enter

### Basic Configuration:
```
enable
configure terminal
hostname RouterLab
enable password cisco
enable secret cisco
service password-encryption
```

### Configure Interface for Switch0:
```
interface gigabitEthernet 0/0
ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0
no shutdown
exit
```

### Configure Interface for Switch1:
```
interface gigabitEthernet 0/1
ip address 192.168.2.1 255.255.255.0
no shutdown
exit
```

### Save Configuration:
```
exit
copy running-config startup-config
```
(Press Enter to confirm)

---

## STEP 4: VERIFY CONFIGURATION

### Run these commands in Router CLI:

```
show ip interface brief
```
(Shows all interfaces and their IPs)

```
show running-config
```
(Shows current configuration)

```
show ip route
```
(Shows routing table)

---

## STEP 5: TEST CONNECTIVITY

### From PC0 (Command Prompt):

**Test same network:**
```
ping 192.168.1.11
```
Expected: 4 replies ✓

**Test different network:**
```
ping 192.168.2.10
```
Expected: 4 replies ✓

**Trace route:**
```
tracert 192.168.2.10
```
Expected: Shows path through router

---

## STEP 6: SCREENSHOTS NEEDED

1. Network topology (full view)
2. PC0 IP configuration
3. PC2 IP configuration
4. Router interface config (GigabitEthernet0/0)
5. Router interface config (GigabitEthernet0/1)
6. show ip interface brief output
7. Successful ping from PC0 to PC2
8. Traceroute output

---

## IMPORTANT COMMANDS SUMMARY

### Configuration Mode:
- enable → Enter privileged mode
- configure terminal → Enter config mode
- exit → Go back one level
- end → Exit to privileged mode

### Interface Commands:
- interface gigabitEthernet 0/0 → Select interface
- ip address [IP] [MASK] → Set IP
- no shutdown → Turn interface ON
- shutdown → Turn interface OFF

### Save & View:
- copy running-config startup-config → Save config
- show running-config → View current config
- show startup-config → View saved config
- show ip interface brief → View all interfaces

### Testing:
- ping [IP] → Test connectivity
- tracert [IP] → Show route path
- arp -a → Show MAC addresses

---

## TROUBLESHOOTING

**If ping fails:**
- Wait 30-60 seconds
- Check all connections are green
- Verify IPs are correct
- Check gateway settings on PCs
- Use "show ip interface brief" on router

**Common mistakes:**
- Forgot "no shutdown" on router interfaces
- Wrong gateway on PCs
- Typos in IP addresses
- Not saving config

---

## CONCLUSION TEMPLATE

Successfully created a two-LAN network connected by a router. Configured router 
interfaces using CLI commands. Tested connectivity between different networks 
using ping and traceroute. All PCs can communicate across LANs through the router.
